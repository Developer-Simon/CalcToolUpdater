# CalcToolUpdater
This project is an electron based update service for my excel calculation tool for business calculations with focus on project business.

## Usage
The Excel-CalculationTool AddIn is free to use (for now), but will be changed to a paid license model. This will become effective with the release of version 2. 

## Changes
Observe all changes to CalcToolUpdater in the file [Changelog.md](CHANGELOG.md)!

Changes to the CalculationTool Excel AddIn are described on the [Release page](https://github.com/Developer-Simon/CalcToolUpdater/releases/).

## Copyright
